# Grade Calculator Web App

This was a project that I made with three colleagues in the Spring 2020 semester for our Software engineering class. It was decided at the start of the semester that every group would create a web app.
This was okay with a lot of people because every group had at least two other members who had taken web development courses.
I mention this of couse because ours was the lone group that didn't have anybody comfortable with the subject.
Even so, I am still proud of what we accomplished, and we all learned a lot a good skills in that classes.

My contributions consisted of the Calculator.vue, Class.vue, GradeCategory.vue, and GradeItem.vue files in the src folder.

Special thanks to Dr. Roberson from Florida Southern College, who's help in ironing out our bugs was invaluable for completing our project.
Also, for teaching the class. That was pretty important too.
